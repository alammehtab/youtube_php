Mixing HTML and PHP in a Script
    
    PHP allows you to write both HTML and PHP code within the same file. This means that you can create a webpage in HTML and then add dynamic content with PHP. By combining HTML with PHP, you can create dynamic web pages that respond to user input or database content.

    CODE:
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <body>
            <h1>My PHP Website</h1>
            <?php
                echo "Hello World!";
            ?>
        </body>
        </html>

    EXPLANATION:
        The "Hello World" message will be rendered as a plain text. However, you can put HTML tags inside the "Hello World" string. The browser will interpret the tags accordingly.

    In the following code, the "echo" statement renders "Hello World" so that it is in <h1> heading with the text aligned at the center of the page.

    CODE:
        <?php
            echo "<h1 align='center'>Hello World!</h1>";
        ?>

PHP Script from Command Prompt

    You can run your PHP script from the command prompt. Let's assume you have the following content in your "hello.php" file.

    CODE:
        <?php
            echo "Hello PHP!!!!!";
        ?>
